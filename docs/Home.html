<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br>
Remake of Master of Olympus : Zeus, a game developed by Impressions Games in 2000.<br>
<br>
We are four first-year students at <a title="EPITA" href="http://epita.fr">EPITA</a>, an engineering French school of Computer Science.</p>
<p>Since I discovered a way (thanks to <a href="http://c3modsquad.freeforums.org/completed-work-sg-reader-t14.html">
Pecunia's work)</a> to obtain all the resources (tiles images, sounds and music) of the original Master of Olympus, I decided to remake this old game with my friends.</p>
